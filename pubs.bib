    abstract = "Human-annotated data plays a critical role in the fairness of AI systems, including those that deal with life-altering decisions or moderating human-created web/social media content. Conventionally, annotator disagreements are resolved before any learning takes place. However, researchers are increasingly identifying annotator disagreement as pervasive and meaningful. They also question the performance of a system when annotators disagree. Particularly when minority views are disregarded, especially among groups that may already be underrepresented in the annotator population. In this paper, we introduce CrowdOpinion, an unsupervised learning based approach that uses language features and label distributions to pool similar items into larger samples of label distributions. We experiment with four generative and one density-based clustering method, applied to five linear combinations of label distributions and features. We use five publicly available benchmark datasets (with varying levels of annotator disagreements) from social media (Twitter, Gab, and Reddit). We also experiment in the wild using a dataset from Facebook, where annotations come from the platform itself by users reacting to posts. We evaluate CrowdOpinion as a label distribution prediction task using KL-divergence and a single-label problem using accuracy measures.",

    abstract = "Annotator disagreement is common whenever human judgment is needed for supervised learning. It is conventional to assume that one label per item represents ground truth. However, this obscures minority opinions, if present. We regard {``}ground truth{''} as the distribution of all labels that a population of annotators could produce, if asked (and of which we only have a small sample). We next introduce DisCo (Distribution from Context), a simple neural model that learns to predict this distribution. The model takes annotator-item pairs, rather than items alone, as input, and performs inference by aggregating over all annotators. Despite its simplicity, our experiments show that, on six benchmark datasets, our model is competitive with, and frequently outperforms, other, more complex models that either do not model specific annotators or were not designed for label distribution learning.",

Our framework ensures scalability by factoring a generative, Bayesian soft clustering model over label distributions into the classic David and Skene joint annotator-data model. Earlier research along these lines has neither fully incorporated label distributions nor explored clustering by annotators only or data only. Our framework incorporates all of these properties within a graphical model designed to provide better ground truth estimates of annotator responses as input to any black box supervised learning algorithm. We conduct supervised learning experiments with variations of our models and compare them to the performance of several baseline models.},

    abstract = {Supervised machine learning often requires humanannotated data. While annotator disagreement is typically interpreted as evidence of noise, population-level label distribution learning (PLDL) treats the collection of annotations for each data item as a sample of the opinions of a population of human annotators, among whom disagreement may be proper and expected, even with no noise present. From this perspective, a typical training set may contain a large number of very small-sized samples, one for each data item, none of which, by itself, is large enough to be considered representative of the underlying populationâ€™s beliefs about that item. We propose an algorithmic framework and new statistical tests for PLDL that account for sampling size. We apply them to previously proposed methods for sharing labels across similar data items. We also propose new approaches for label sharing, which we call neighborhood-based pooling.},

 abstract = {Sri Lankans made over 100 million visits to public and private outpatient departments (OPD) during 2015, which is estimated to double in 2027. However, these visits have no records, either paper or electronic. Medical records are essential to provide continuity of care, and computer-based medical records were identified as essential technology in 1990 by the Institute of Medicine. The main initiative of the Ministry of Health addresses either OPD health information system or inward system, but it is limited to a few selected hospitals. There are no electronic health records (EHR) that can track patients as they crisscross between different primary care providers in public and private sectors, which is the normal behaviour of the majority of our patients. This paper gives a snapshot of the current healthcare system in Sri Lanka, notes the existing projects related to primary care health information systems, briefly reviews the current status of the global primary care EHR and describes our solution of a generic, cloud-based, open source EHR for use across public and private sectors focusing on a patient-centred electronic 'personal health record'. We opted to modify a time-tested software solution OpenEMR-https://www.open-emr.org/OpenEMR is a free and open source, ONC certified, electronic health records and medical practice management application featuring fully integrated electronic health records, practice management, scheduling, electronic billing, internationalization, and multi-lingual support. Sri Lanka OpenEMR (SLOEMR) is now used at the University Family Medicine Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya at Ragama. Paper medical records of more than a decade were converted to the electronic format. We are in the planning process of piloting the SLOEMR in the Ragama Medical Officer of Health Area with a population of 70,000, with a single electronic record for each person across all private and public sector healthcare providers.},

This research presents KeyXtract which enhances the machine learning based Stanford CoreNLP Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger with the Twitter model to extract essential keywords from a tweet. The system was developed using rule-based parsers and two corpora. The data for the research was obtained from a Twitter profile of a telecommunication company. The system development consisted of two stages. At the initial stage, a domain specific corpus was compiled after analysing the tweets. The POS tagger extracted the Noun Phrases and Verb Phrases while the parsers removed noise and extracted any other keywords missed by the POS tagger. The system was evaluated using the Turing Test. After it was tested and compared against Stanford CoreNLP, the second stage of the system was developed addressing the shortcomings of the first stage. It was enhanced using Named Entity Recognition and Lemmatization. The second stage was also tested using the Turing test and its pass rate increased},

This research enhances the machine learning based Stanford CoreNLP Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger with the Twitter model to extract essential keywords from a tweet. The system was enhanced using two rule-based parsers and a corpus. The research was conducted using tweets of customer service requests sent to a telecommunication company. A domain specific corpus was compiled after analyzing the tweets. The POS tagger extracted the keywords while the parsers removed any possible noise and extracted any other keywords missed by the POS tagger. The evaluation of the system was done using the Turing Test. The proposed system was tested and compared against the Stanford CoreNLP. The testing was conducted using 6 test cases, each consisting of a human keyword generator and a supervisor. In order to ensure the impartiality and intellectual diversity, the response generators and supervisors were representatives of 6 different fields. As a result of the enhancements, the Turing Test score of the system increased from 50.00},

 abstract = {Sri Lankan English (SLE) has unique phonological, morphological, lexical and syntactic features which have gradually developed since the introduction of English to Sri Lanka. Vocabulary is one of the first features to develop in SLE. Although the SLE vocabulary has been studied and recorded, its generational difference has not been examined. The objective of the study was to investigate if the â€˜generational change' observable in the SLE vocabulary could be considered an evolution. This was done through a qualitative, comparative analysis of the vocabulary used in the decades 1955 â€“ 1965 and 2005 â€“ 2015. The theoretical base of the research was defined using two theories of language evolution: the apparent-time hypothesis and age-gradedness. The primary data was taken from the Ceylon Observer of the decade 1955 â€“ 1965 and the Sunday Observer of the decade 2005 - 2015. The words were used in a questionnaire survey of 60 participants of which 30 were of the age 15 â€“ 25 years and 30 were of the age 65- 75 years. The results of the survey were then analyzed in detail through 10 interviews. The surveys and the interviews were conducted to prove/disprove the age-gradedness of the SLE vocabulary and to prove/disprove the apparent-time hypothesis in relation to the SLE vocabulary. Most of the vocabulary used disproved age-gradedness. The usages of these terms were found to be generation specific, which supported that the SLE vocabulary is not age-graded. The interviews supported the apparent-time hypotheses as the older generation showed that their vocabulary has not changed significantly over the years. From these observations, it could be concluded that within the scope of the research, the generational difference observable in the SLE vocabulary over 60 years could be termed an evolution.},
